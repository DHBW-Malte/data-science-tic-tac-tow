# Pseudocode:

# Begin
# Print the game board
# Prepare nested Array to store the game
# Aking player to choose X or O
# Start game loop (9 rounds)
    # Asking player X for a field
    # Check: Is field already taken and if the field is inside of the game board (using numberCheck array)
        # If check failed asking player X again for a field
        # If check was successful place X on the field
    # Check: Did player X wins
        # Check the winning combination
            # If player wins, stop loop
            # If not continue
        # If the player didn't win continue
    # Computer makes a random move
    # Check: Is field already taken and if the field is inside of the game board (using numberCheck array)
        # If check failed asking computer X again for a field
        # If check was successful place X on the field
    # Check if computer wins
        # If computer wins, stop loop
        # If not continue
    # Checking for a free number
# End of loop
# Printing winning, draw or loosing message
# Asking user to play again

#   X | X | X
#   4 | 5 | 6
#   7 | 8 | 9

# win combinations:

# numberCheck = [X,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# one = null

# one == two & one == three
# one == four & one == seven

# X +- 1
